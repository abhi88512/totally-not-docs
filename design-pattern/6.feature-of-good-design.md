### Features of Good Design

Good software architecture aims to promote qualities like code reuse and extensibility while avoiding pitfalls such as tight coupling and inflexibility. These principles help reduce development costs and time, allowing faster market entry and more resources for other areas like marketing.

#### Code Reuse
Code reuse is a key strategy to lower development costs by leveraging existing code across projects, avoiding redundant work from scratch. However, challenges arise when code is tightly coupled, depends on concrete classes rather than interfaces, or includes hardcoded elements, making adaptation to new contexts difficult and time-consuming.

Design patterns address this by enhancing component flexibility, though they may increase complexity. Erich Gamma, a co-author of the seminal *Design Patterns* book, describes reuse on three levels:
- **Lowest level**: Reusing individual classes, such as libraries or containers (e.g., container/iterator teams).
- **Middle level**: Design patterns, which are abstract descriptions of how classes interact, enabling reuse of design ideas without the risks of full implementations.
- **Highest level**: Frameworks, like JUnit, which define key abstractions and relationships. They follow the "Hollywood principle" ("don't call us, we'll call you"), where the framework controls flow and invokes user-defined behavior.

Patterns offer a balanced, lower-risk approach to reuse compared to frameworks, allowing independent application of concepts.

#### Extensibility
Software must adapt to inevitable changes, as "change is the only constant" in development. Examples include porting a Windows game to macOS, updating UI trends (e.g., from square to round buttons), or adding features like phone orders to an e-commerce site.

Reasons for changes include:
- **Better problem understanding**: Initial development reveals deeper insights, often prompting rewrites as skills grow and early code seems inadequate.
- **External factors**: Unforeseen shifts, like browser discontinuation of Flash, force migrations.
- **Evolving requirements**: Clients discover new possibilities post-launch, requesting expansions that weren't in original plans.

The positive aspect is that requests for changes indicate ongoing interest in the software. Experienced developers anticipate this by designing architectures that accommodate future modifications, minimizing rework and ensuring longevity.
