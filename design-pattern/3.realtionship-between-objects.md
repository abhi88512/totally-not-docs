**Relations Between Objects - Definition and Description**:

- **Dependency**:
  - **Definition**: A weak relationship where changes in one class may require modifications in another.
  - **Description**: Occurs when a class uses another class, e.g., in method signatures or object instantiation. For example, a `Professor` class depending on a `Course` class breaks if `Course`’s `getKnowledge()` method changes. Using interfaces or abstract classes weakens this dependency. UML diagrams typically show only significant dependencies to avoid clutter.

- **Association**:
  - **Definition**: A relationship where one object interacts with another, often through a persistent link like a field or method.
  - **Description**: Represents ongoing interactions, e.g., a `Professor` class with a `Student` field. Unlike simple dependency, association implies a lasting connection, such as a method accessing the `Student` object to call `remember()`. In UML, shown as an arrow, bidirectional if both objects interact. Can exist between interfaces via methods.

- **Aggregation**:
  - **Definition**: A “whole-part” relationship where one object (container) contains others (components), but components can exist independently.
  - **Description**: For example, a `Department` contains `Professors`, but professors can exist without the department. Represents “has-a” relationships, like one-to-many or many-to-many. In UML, shown with a line and an empty diamond at the container end. Quantities may be omitted if contextually clear.

- **Composition**:
  - **Definition**: A stricter form of aggregation where components cannot exist without the container, which manages their lifecycle.
  - **Description**: For example, a `University` consists of `Departments`, which cease to exist if the university is removed. In UML, depicted like aggregation but with a filled diamond at the container end. Often, “composition” is used broadly to include both aggregation and composition in casual discussion.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Definition**: A relationship where a class provides implementations for methods declared in an interface, allowing objects to be treated as the interface type.
  - **Description**: For example, an `Airplane` class implements the `FlyingTransport` interface’s `fly()` method. This allows an `Airport` class to interact with any `FlyingTransport` object (e.g., `Airplane`, `Helicopter`) without knowing its concrete type. In UML, shown as a dashed arrow from the class to the interface.

- **Inheritance**:
  - **Definition**: A relationship where a subclass inherits attributes and methods from a superclass, extending or overriding them for specialization.
  - **Description**: Establishes an “is-a” relationship, e.g., a `Dog` class inherits `run()` from `Animal` but overrides `makeSound()` with `bark()`. Subclasses reuse superclass functionality and must implement any abstract methods. In UML, shown as a solid arrow from subclass to superclass. Typically, a class extends one superclass but can implement multiple interfaces.

## Examples in ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)

Below are simple examples demonstrating each object relationship concept using ASP.NET Core Web API in .NET 8. Each example is minimal, self-contained, and uses a university-related domain for consistency.

### 1. Dependency
**Example**: A `ProfessorController` depends on a `CourseService` to retrieve course details.

```csharp
// CourseService.cs
public class CourseService
{
    public string GetCourseDetails(int courseId)
    {
        return $"Course {courseId}: Programming 101";
    }
}

// ProfessorController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProfessorController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CourseService _courseService;

    public ProfessorController(CourseService courseService)
    {
        _courseService = courseService; // Dependency injected
    }

    [HttpGet("{courseId}")]
    public IActionResult GetCourse(int courseId)
    {
        var details = _courseService.GetCourseDetails(courseId); // Dependency on CourseService
        return Ok(details);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `ProfessorController` depends on `CourseService` via constructor injection, a common ASP.NET Core pattern.
- The dependency is evident as `ProfessorController` calls `GetCourseDetails` on `CourseService`.
- If `CourseService.GetCourseDetails` changes (e.g., its signature), `ProfessorController` may need updates, illustrating a weak dependency. Using an interface like `ICourseService` could reduce this coupling.

### 2. Association
**Example**: A `Professor` model has a reference to a `Student` object, representing a teaching relationship.

```csharp
// Student.cs
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string GetKnowledge() => $"{Name} has learned basics.";
}

// Professor.cs
public class Professor
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Student AssignedStudent { get; set; } // Association
}

// ProfessorController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProfessorController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{professorId}/student")]
    public IActionResult GetAssignedStudent(int professorId)
    {
        var professor = new Professor
        {
            Id = professorId,
            Name = "Dr. Smith",
            AssignedStudent = new Student { Id = 1, Name = "John" } // Persistent link
        };
        return Ok(professor.AssignedStudent.GetKnowledge());
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `Professor` holds a reference to a `Student` via the `AssignedStudent` property, indicating a persistent association.
- Unlike a temporary dependency, this relationship implies an ongoing connection (e.g., a professor mentoring a student).
- The `GetAssignedStudent` endpoint accesses the associated `Student` to call `GetKnowledge`, demonstrating the interaction.

### 3. Aggregation
**Example**: A `Department` contains multiple `Professors`, but professors can exist independently.

```csharp
// Professor.cs
public class Professor
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// Department.cs
public class Department
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List<Professor> Professors { get; set; } = new List<Professor>(); // Aggregation
}

// DepartmentController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class DepartmentController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{departmentId}")]
    public IActionResult GetDepartment(int departmentId)
    {
        var department = new Department
        {
            Id = departmentId,
            Name = "Computer Science",
            Professors = new List<Professor>
            {
                new Professor { Id = 1, Name = "Dr. Smith" },
                new Professor { Id = 2, Name = "Dr. Jones" }
            }
        };
        return Ok(department);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `Department` contains a list of `Professors`, representing a "has-a" relationship (aggregation).
- Professors can exist independently of the department (e.g., they could join another department or none).
- The `GetDepartment` endpoint returns the department with its professors, showing the whole-part relationship.

### 4. Composition
**Example**: A `University` contains `Departments`, which are destroyed if the university is removed.

```csharp
// Department.cs
public class Department
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// University.cs
public class University
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List<Department> Departments { get; set; } = new List<Department>(); // Composition

    public University()
    {
        // Departments are created as part of University
        Departments.Add(new Department { Id = 1, Name = "Computer Science" });
        Departments.Add(new Department { Id = 2, Name = "Mathematics" });
    }
}

// UniversityController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UniversityController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{universityId}")]
    public IActionResult GetUniversity(int universityId)
    {
        var university = new University { Id = universityId, Name = "State University" };
        return Ok(university);
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `University` manages the lifecycle of its `Departments`, creating them in its constructor.
- If the `University` is deleted, its `Departments` cease to exist, demonstrating composition.
- The `GetUniversity` endpoint returns the university with its departments, showing the strict whole-part relationship.

### 5. Implementation
**Example**: An `Airplane` implements an `IFlyingTransport` interface, used by an `AirportService`.

```csharp
// IFlyingTransport.cs
public interface IFlyingTransport
{
    string Fly();
}

// Airplane.cs
public class Airplane : IFlyingTransport
{
    public string Fly() => "Airplane is flying.";
}

// AirportService.cs
public class AirportService
{
    private readonly IFlyingTransport _transport;

    public AirportService(IFlyingTransport transport)
    {
        _transport = transport; // Interface-based dependency
    }

    public string Operate() => _transport.Fly();
}

// AirportController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AirportController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly AirportService _airportService;

    public AirportController(AirportService airportService)
    {
        _airportService = airportService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult OperateTransport()
    {
        return Ok(_airportService.Operate());
    }
}

// Program.cs (Dependency Injection Setup)
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFlyingTransport, Airplane>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<AirportService>();
```

**Explanation**:
- `Airplane` implements the `IFlyingTransport` interface, providing the `Fly` method.
- `AirportService` depends on `IFlyingTransport`, allowing it to work with any implementation (e.g., `Airplane`, `Helicopter`) without knowing the concrete type.
- The `OperateTransport` endpoint demonstrates polymorphism by calling `Fly` through the interface.

### 6. Inheritance
**Example**: A `Dog` class inherits from an `Animal` base class, overriding a method.

```csharp
// Animal.cs
public abstract class Animal
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual string MakeSound() => "Some sound";
}

// Dog.cs
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override string MakeSound() => "Bark";
}

// AnimalController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AnimalController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetAnimalSound(int id)
    {
        Animal animal = new Dog { Id = id, Name = "Buddy" };
        return Ok(animal.MakeSound());
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, reusing properties (`Id`, `Name`) and overriding `MakeSound` to return "Bark".
- This demonstrates an "is-a" relationship: a `Dog` is an `Animal`.
- The `GetAnimalSound` endpoint treats `Dog` as an `Animal`, showcasing inheritance and polymorphism.

### Notes
- These examples are designed to be minimal and run in a new ASP.NET Core Web API project (`dotnet new webapi -n ExampleApi`).
- Dependency injection is used where applicable to align with ASP.NET Core best practices.
- No external dependencies (e.g., databases) are included for simplicity.
- For production, add error handling, logging, and data persistence as needed.
