**Design Patterns**

Design patterns are reusable, customizable solutions to common software design problems, acting as blueprints rather than specific code. 

Unlike algorithms, which provide clear steps to achieve a goal, design patterns offer high-level concepts tailored to a program’s needs. They differ from algorithms like a blueprint differs from a recipe—patterns outline the solution’s structure and features, leaving implementation details flexible.

**Components of a Pattern Description:**
- **Intent**: Briefly outlines the problem and solution.
- **Motivation**: Explains the problem and solution in depth.
- **Structure**: Shows how pattern components relate.


**Classification of Patterns:**
- **Idioms**: Basic, language-specific patterns.
- **Architectural Patterns**: High-level patterns for designing entire applications, applicable across languages.
- Patterns are grouped by intent:
  - **Creational**: Enhance object creation flexibility and code reuse.
  - **Structural**: Assemble objects/classes into flexible, efficient structures.
  - **Behavioral**: Manage communication and responsibilities between objects.

**Origin of Design Patterns:**
The concept originated with Christopher Alexander’s *A Pattern Language* (1977), which described patterns for urban design. In 1994, Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm adapted this idea in *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, introducing 23 patterns for object-oriented programming. Known as the “GoF book,” it popularized the pattern approach, which has since expanded to other programming fields.
